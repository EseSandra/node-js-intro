QUESTION 1

• Define Monolithic architecture

Monolithic architecture is a unified architecture where there is no separation between services or components of the application.Monolithic architecture is a singular, large computing network with one code base that couples all of the business concerns together.


QUESTION 2

• Explain microservices in your own understanding

Microservices architecture is one of the backend architecture and a piece of a larger application.It is a type of application architecture where the application is developed as a collection of services. It provides the framework to deploy, develop and maintain microservices architecture diagrams and services independently.

Microservices allow a large application to be separated into smaller independent parts, with each part having its own realm of responsibility.It's an architectural pattern that arranges an application as a collection of loosely coupled, fine-grained services, communicating through lightweight protocols.

QUESTION 3

• Which of the backend architecture appeals to you and why?

The microservices architecture appeals to me because microservices are deployed independently, it's easier to manage bug fixes and feature releases. You can update a service without redeploying the entire application, and roll back an update if something goes wrong.

QUESTION 4

• Is NodeJS a multithreaded language?

NodeJS runs JavaScript code in a single thread, which means that your code can only do one task at a time. However, NodeJS itself is multithreaded and provides hidden threads through the libuv library, which handles I/O operations like reading files from a disk or network requests. Through the use of hidden threads, NodeJS provides asynchronous methods that allow your code to make I/O requests without blocking the main thread.

QUESTION 5

• What does REPL stand for?

REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop. It provide an interactive environment to explore tools available in specific environments or programming languages.
